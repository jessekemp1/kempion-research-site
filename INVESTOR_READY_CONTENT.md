## Content Flow: What Investors See

### 1. HERO (First Impression - 3 seconds)

```
KEMPION
— Research —

AI that measures itself against reality.
```

**Impact**: Concrete, humble, measurable. Sets accountability tone.

---

### 2. THESIS (Core Message - 15 seconds)

```
Decision Intelligence Research

Intelligence measured by outcomes, not confidence.

We build decision systems that remember context, show uncertainty
honestly, and learn from results.

Most AI is fluent but unreliable. Our systems optimize for calibration:
when we say 70% likely, it happens 70% of the time.
```

**Word count**: 60 words (down from 200)
**Impact**: Scannable, specific (70% example), differentiates from AI hype

---

### 3. THREE PILLARS (Framework - 20 seconds)

| Pillar | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Memory** | Goals, constraints, history, and domain knowledge persist across decisions. No amnesia. |
| **Scenario Bands** | Optimistic, likely, and conservative ranges. Plus the conditions that would shift the forecast. |
| **Learning** | Every prediction compared against outcome. Error measured, model improved. |

**Impact**: Active voice, concrete, memorable ("No amnesia")

## Content Strategy

### Removed (Fluffy/Redundant)
- ❌ "ADVANCING DECISION INTELLIGENCE" from Hero
- ❌ Entire "Deeper Dive" expandable section (~150 lines)
- ❌ "These tools help individuals and organizations make better choices when..."
- ❌ Multiple repetitions of "hoping to knowing"
- ❌ Vague proof: "VortexV2 | Alpha Arena | Cortex" (no data)

### Added (Concrete/Credible)
- ✅ "AI that measures itself against reality" (Hero)
- ✅ "Intelligence measured by outcomes, not confidence" (core thesis)
- ✅ 70% calibration example (makes "calibration" concrete)
- ✅ Data cards with real metrics (3.3%, 2.05 Sharpe, +23.7%)
- ✅ IMOCA 60 reference (real-world application)
- ✅ Clear CTA button with pre-filled email
