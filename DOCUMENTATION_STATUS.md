## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Content (8-10 hours) - HIGH PRIORITY

2. Proof of Work component

### Phase 2: Vision & Impact (5-7 hours) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
3. Future Vision component
4. Impact Statement component
5. Call to Action component

### Phase 3: Enhancements (2-3 hours) - OPTIONAL
