## The 5 Whys

**Why build AI systems?**
→ To make better decisions under uncertainty

**Why do decisions under uncertainty matter?**
→ Because every meaningful choice—sailing an ocean, deploying capital, building a life—happens without complete information

**Why can't existing AI help with this?**
→ Because confidence ≠ reliability. Current AI speaks fluently about things it doesn't know. It has no skin in the game.

**Why does that matter?**
→ Because false certainty is more dangerous than honest uncertainty. A wrong answer delivered confidently leads to worse outcomes than "I don't know."

**Why build this yourself?**
→ **Because the gap between hoping and knowing is where life happens. And no one is building AI that's honest about that gap.**

## Draft Core Text

> **Intelligence should be measured by outcomes, not confidence.**
>
> Most AI is fluent but unreliable. It speaks with certainty about things it doesn't know. We're building systems that remember context, show uncertainty honestly, and learn from results.
>
> When we say 70% likely, it should happen 70% of the time. That's calibration. That's the difference between hoping and knowing.
